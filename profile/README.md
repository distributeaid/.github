# Distribute Aid

Distribute Aid delivers humanitarian aid to communities in need.

By coordinating end-to-end shipments, we make it easy for donors to connect with frontline aid organisations, understand the needs on the ground, and get their aid delivered.

## 📅 Upcoming Events

You can find all of our upcoming free open-source coding events on [our Open Collective events page](https://opencollective.com/distribute-aid-usa/events).  We'll update this section at the start of each month with upcoming events for that month.

## ⛑️ Contributing

The foundation of the refugee aid movement is built by
everyday folks putting in a few hours every week, and you should be proud to be
a part of it.

Through your work with Distribute Aid you will make it easier for hundreds of
aid workers on the ground to improve the lives of tens of thousands of
newcomers.

We're on track to save
refugee aid groups hundreds of hours and create hundreds of thousands of Euros
in value for the refugee aid supply chain every year!

We take a people-first approach at Distribute Aid, and will do our best to match
you up with work that fits your skill set and interests. Please introduce
yourself in [our Slack](https://distributeaid.github.io/slack-invite-link/) and

We'll match you with one of our tech leads to get you started on your first
contribution on one of our tech projects.

### 📦 Shipment Tracker

The goal of this project is to provide a system for collecting aid offers and organizing them into pallets appropriate for a shipment. Using the system, Distribute Aid administrators can create shipments, aid donors can organize their aid for donation into offers for a shipment and provide the information necessary for a Distribute Aid hub coordinator and logistics coordinator to process it for international shipping to refugees.

### 📋 Needs Assessment

The goal of this project is to provide a way for Distribute Aid to run needs assessment using forms that can be modified using low-code or zero-code approach. These forms need to provide validation and flow logic.
